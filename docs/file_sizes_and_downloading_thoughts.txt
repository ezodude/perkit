Wiznet ethernet module: 230 kbps = 28,750 bytes per second

Avg IT conversation podcast: 15 MB = 15,728,640 bytes

How many seconds would it take to transfer a 15 MB podcast: 547.08 seconds = about 9 mins.  

115200 pulses per second (max baud rate for arduino)
14400 bytes per second

it will at least take double the amount of time to move a 15MB podcast from web to arduino (18 minutes)

----

1 MB = 1,048,576 bytes maybe downloaded in:  36.5 seconds (best case scenario)



1 byte is 8 pulses
1 byte per millisecond
